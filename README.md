# Analyzing-Personal-Netflix-Data-Using-Python-programming

‘How much time have I spent watching a show on Netflix?’
That's a question that has run through my head repeatedly over the past one year. Due to the ongoing pandemic, Netflix was literally a life savior. However, the data Netflix allowed users to download about their activity was extremely limited. Now, though, Netflix allows you to download a veritable treasure-trove of data about your account. With a just Python and pandas programming, we can now get a concrete answer to the question: how much time have I spent watching a show on Netflix?
During the pandemic, I was hooked to a show called ‘The Vampire Diaries’. I was so addicted to the show that I used to spend 8 hours a day watching it. So, in this project, I’ll be
plotting a chart of my viewing habits by day of the week as well as the same data by hour.
The two plots will tell you that on which day of the week and during
was the show watched the most.
